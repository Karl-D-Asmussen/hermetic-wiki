<!-- CATEGORY technologies -->

A Brain Jar is a device used in hermetosympathetic design. It consists of a hollow
jar --- often glazed, fired clay --- in the shape of a human brain. By the properties
of sympathy, it can be filled with a TK, and then cast the corresponding spell without
the need of intervention from a wizard. The energy reuirement is often
quite substantial, but can be kept managable by using extremely simple spells and
high level of realistic detail in manufacture.
